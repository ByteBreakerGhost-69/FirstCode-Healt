## ✨ About This Project  

This project is more than just lines of code.  
It is a heartfelt expression.

A visual creation in the shape of *love* ❤️,  
with the words written inside:

> **Assalamualaikum, future wife and mother of my children.**

This project was inspired by someone who made me believe in beauty again.  
Thank you for being a part of my life, even if only for a short time.
